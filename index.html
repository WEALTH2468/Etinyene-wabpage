    <h2>MY MOTIVATION TOWARDS CAPACITYBAY PROGRAM</h2>
    <P>
            My name is Etinyene Ededem, I base in Port Hacourt, all my life have always wanted to be a software engineer, I love being around
            the computers always doing one thing and the other with it, try to get into different trainings on programming but coudnt due to hw 
            expensive it is, but thanks to CAPACITYBAY and all the faculties who came together in order to make this program free to people
            like me who was unable to afford it, to finally get a chance, i am so greatfull, so on behave of me and all the student in CAPACITYBAY we
            say thank you, God bless you all. An I personally have promised to make the bast out of this oppotunity <br>
            For a long time i used to wonder what am gonna be in life in the furture, sometimes when i see and old person still strugling to suviver
            i cant help but asked myself <i>WHAT WERE THERE DOING WHEN THEY WERE AT MY AGE?</i> Sometimes i even wonder hope am not doing the same thing,<br>
            But thanks to CAPACITYBAY that fear is gone, each and everyday studying in CAPACITYBAY from their fantastic faculties I see myself geting closer
            to my dreams everyday. Have always imaging myself working with the best software company in the world and i kw that is if i play my cards well 
            with the help of CAPACITYBAY 5years is even to long for that dreams to come true couse by then i should be a computer/programming guru.

    </P>
